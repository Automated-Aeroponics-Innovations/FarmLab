The ultimate goal of FarmLab is to one day produce a scalable, ML-operated aeroponics pilot program that can support the subsistence agriculture needs of communities in food deserts - that's serving thousands of people from a single site the size of a football field.  This endeavor was largely inspired by the research conducted by [NASA on the ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/content/growing-plants-in-space).


One day very soon, every city will have many of these [vertical farming implementations](https://verticalharvestfarms.com/) snuggled between its sky scrapers providing produce to local grocery stores and eliminating worries about supply chain interruption.  In addition to addressing food insecurity, these innovative digital farms are the key to addressing logistical imperatives towards the goal of one day colonizing Mars.  However, aeroponics is only truly viable at scale when it is fully automated and adaptable to unanticipated changes in environment. MLOps is where CI/CD in enterprise environments are headed.  Even as ML Engineers are becoming more and more highly sought after, not many companies have determined how to fully utilize them.  MLOps is imperative to the successful implementation of high-yield aeroponics applications (and many other highly complex systems).  Changes to the environment or shifts in key nutrient levels can occur with seeming randomness that a well-trained algorithm might not anticipate.  This requires an automated CI/CD pipeline to provision regular retraining and deployment of the algorithm on the data.  tadGan without MLOps would declare unanticipated changes anomalous but tadGan with MLOps has the added nuance of freshly acquired datasets for retraining that add previously unobserved insights.  
 
 
Another significant contributing factor to implementing a scalable digital farm is nanoengineered IoT sensors.  In 2017, MIT published research on the use of nanofluidic sensors to signal indications of [water stress in plants](https://news.mit.edu/2017/sensors-applied-plant-leaves-warn-water-shortage-1108https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/LC/C7LC00930E#!divAbstract).  In addition, Cornell recently recived a substantial award in support of their ground breaking [digital agriculture research center](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/09/25m-center-will-use-digital-tools-communicate-plants)

Dr. Abraham Stroock at Cornell is one of a handful of scientists pioneering this discipline of nanoengineered IoT sensors applied to digital agriculture.  Dr. Stroock's research expertise is in nano-fluidics as relates to water in plants.  He's developing IoT devices, specifically nano-sensors to read the amount of water held in the vessels inside of a leaf.  A 25 million dollar investment by the the National Science Foundation in September 2021 further elevates the relevance of Dr. Stroock's work as well as the work of researchers with similar vision.  
 

FarmLab, and similar digital agriculture projects, will one day help us to solve food insecurity and to open the door to deep space exploration.  Think of FarmLab as one among the first handful  of state of the art prototypes for systems so precise that they regulate nutrient delivery and lighting based on the output of a sensor on a single leaf of a plant.  This is the core purpose of FarmLab, digital agriculture innovation.  What FarmLab proposes is not simply a lab fully automated by ML algorithms, but a lab regulated by the very plants themselves.  

If we take FarmLab even a single step beyond its current research purpose as an agricultural automation system in the hopes of identifying additional means of its utility, we can envision that process analytical technologies such as the integration of nanoengineered biosensors with MLOps via bioinformatics software are effectively creating an artificial biofeedback system in turn meant to emulate autonomic responses with accuracy and precision.  As a considerable example, if it is our aim to one day very soon fabricate prostheses that fully emulate the human body, this is a good preparatory step to creating prosthetic limbs and organs which operate with equivalent sense and sensation as those anatomies which they are intended to replace.
